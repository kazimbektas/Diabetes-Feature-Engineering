# Diabetes-Feature-Engineering


## 1 Business Problem
The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of individuals being diagnosed with diabetes based on specific features. Before model development, essential steps in data analysis and feature engineering will be conducted.

## 2 Dataset Story
The dataset is sourced from a larger dataset maintained by the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases** in the United States. This specific dataset focuses on a study of **Pima Indian women** aged 21 and above living in **Phoenix, Arizona**. The target variable, `Outcome`, represents whether an individual has tested positive for diabetes (1) or negative (0).

## 2.1 Dataset Variables
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Diabetes test result (1 for positive, 0 for negative)
